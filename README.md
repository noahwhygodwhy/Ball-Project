# Ball-Project
This is a project for my Computational Geometry course at RIT. It is to demonstrate knowledge of space partitioning systems, and to allow the user to see how the systems work interactively.

It is build in typescript using webgl to display the output.

Up and running at https://cs.rit.edu/~nza3552/CSCI716/
